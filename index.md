# Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science

__Boaz Barak__

_Work in progress_


This is a textbook in preparation for an introductory undergraduate course on theoretical computer science.
I am using this text for [Harvard CS 121](http://cs121.boazbarak.org).
It is also used for [UVa CS 3102](https://uvatoc.github.io) and [UCLA CS181](https://hackmd.io/@raghum/introtcs).


See below for individual chapters. You can also download the [book in a single PDF file](https://files.boazbarak.org/introtcs/lnotes_book.pdf) (about 600 pages, 10MB).

If you have any _comments, suggestions, typo fixes_, etc.. I would be very grateful if you post them as an [**issue**](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/issues) or [**pull request**](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/pulls) in the [**GitHub repository boazbk/tcs**](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs) where I am maintaining the source files for these notes.
You can also post comments on each chapter in the links below.


See the [github.com/boazbk/tcscode](the tcscode repository) for jupyter notebooks with supplementary code for the book.


For prior versions of the book, see the [repository release page](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/releases). The most updated version of this book is always on this page.


__Frozen version for Fall 20223:__ I will be only making minor edits (typos, local fixes) during the fall so as not to disrupt teaching. For consistency in references and exercises, instructors can use  the following version frozen as of July 24, 2023:  [Introduction to TCS version 0.95](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/releases/download/v0.95/lnotes_book_fall2023.pdf)
