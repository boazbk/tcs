# Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science

__Boaz Barak__

_Work in progress_


This is a textbook in preparation for an introductory undergraduate course on theoretical computer science.
I am using this text for [Harvard CS 121](http://cs121.boazbarak.org).


See below for individual chapters. You can also download:

* [Book in a single PDF file](https://files.boazbarak.org/introtcs/lnotes_book.pdf) (about 600 pages, 10MB).

* [Table of contents](https://files.boazbarak.org/introtcs/contents.pdf).


If you have any _comments, suggestions, typo fixes_, etc.. I would be very grateful if you post them as an [**issue**](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/issues) or [**pull request**](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/pulls) in the [**GitHub repository boazbk/tcs**](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs) where I am maintaining the source files for these notes.
You can also post comments on each chapter in the links below.
The repository [github.com/boazbk/tcscode](https://github.com/boazbk/tcscode)  will eventually contain all supplemantary code and online appendices for this book.

I am revising the book in the spring of 2019. For prior versions of the book, see the [repository release page](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/releases).
The most updated version of this book is always on this page.
