In this chapter, we  review some of the mathematical concepts that we will use in this course.
Most of these are not very complicated, but do require some practice and exercise to get comfortable with.
If you have not previously encountered some of these concepts, there are several excellent freely-available resources online that cover them, see the "Bibliographical Notes" section ([notesmathchap](){.ref}).



## A mathematician's apology

Before explaining the math background, perhaps I should explain why is this course so "mathematically heavy".
After all, this is supposed to be a course about _computation_; one might think we should be talking mostly about  _programs_, rather than more "mathematical" objects such as  _sets_, _functions_, and _graphs_, and doing more _coding_ on an actual computer than writing mathematical proofs with pen and paper.
So, why are we doing so much math in this course?
Is it just some form of hazing? Perhaps a revenge of the ["math nerds" against the "hackers"](https://blog.smartbear.com/careers/math-nerds-vs-code-monkeys-should-computer-science-classes-be-more-practical/)?

At the end of the day, mathematics is simply a language for modeling concepts in a precise and unambiguous way.
In this course,  we will be mostly interested in the concept of _computation_.
For example, we will look at questions such as  _"is there an efficient algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer?"_.^[Actually, scientists currently do not know the answer to this question, but we will see that settling it in either direction has very interesting applications touching on areas as far apart as Internet security and quantum mechanics.]
To even _phrase_ such a question, we need to give a precise _definition_ of the notion of an _algorithm_, and of what it means for an algorithm to be _efficient_.
Also, if the answer to this or similar questions turns out to be _negative_, then this cannot be shown by simply writing and executing some code.
After all, there is no empirical experiment that will prove the _nonexistence_ of an algorithm.
Thus, our only way to show this type of _negative result_ is to use _mathematical proofs_.
So you can  see why our main tools in this course will be mathematical proofs and definitions.

##  This chapter: a reader's manual   { #manualbackground}

Depending on your background, you can approach this chapter in two different ways:

* If you already have taken some proof-based courses, and are very familiar with the notions of discrete mathematics, you can take a quick look at [secmathoverview](){.ref} to see the main tools we will use, [notationsec](){.ref} for our notation and conventions, and then skip ahead to the rest of this book. Alternatively, you can  sit back, relax, and read this chapter just to get familiar with our notation, as well as to enjoy (or not) my philosophical musings and attempts at humor. You might also want to start brushing up on _discrete probability_, which we'll use later in this course.



* If your background is not as extensive, you should lean forward, and read this chapter with a pen and paper handy, making notes and working out derivations as you go along. We cannot fit a semester-length discrete math course in a single chapter, and hence will be necessarily brief in our discussions. Thus you might want to occasionally pause to watch some discrete math lectures, read some of the resources mentioned in [notesmathchap](){.ref}, and do some exercises to make sure you internalized the material.






## A quick overview of mathematical prerequisites { #secmathoverview }



The main notions we will use in this course are the following:

* __Proofs:__ First and foremost, this course will involve a heavy dose of formal mathematical reasoning, which includes mathematical _definitions_, _statements_, and _proofs_.

* __Sets:__ The basic set _relationships_ of membership ($\in$), containment ($\subseteq$), and set _operations_, principally union, intersection, set difference and Cartesian product ($\cup,\cap,\setminus$ and $\times$).

* __Tuples and strings:__ The set $\Sigma^k$ of length-$k$ strings/lists over elements in $\Sigma$, where $\Sigma$ is some finite set which is called the _alphabet_ (quite often $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$). We use $\Sigma^*$ for the set of all strings of finite length.

* __Some special sets:__ The set $\N$ of natural numbers. We will index from zero in this course and so write $\N = \{0,1,2,\ldots \}$. We will use $[n]$ for the set $\{0,1,2,\ldots,n-1\}$. We use $\{0,1\}^*$ for the set of all binary strings and $\{0,1\}^n$ for the set of strings of length $n$. If $x$ is a string of length $n$, then we refer to its coordinate by $x_0,\ldots,x_{n-1}$.

* __Functions:__ The _domain_ and _codomain_ of a function, properties such as being _one-to-one_ (also known as _injective_) or _onto_ (also known as _surjective_) functions, as well as  _partial functions_ (that, unlike standard or "total" functions, are not necessarily defined on all elements of their domain).

* __Logical operations:__ The operations AND, OR, and NOT ($\wedge,\vee,\neg$) and the quantifiers "there exists" and "for all" ($\exists$,$\forall$).

* __Basic combinatorics:__ Notions such as $\binom{n}{k}$ (the number of $k$-sized subsets of a set of size $n$).

* __Graphs:__ Undirected and directed graphs, connectivity, paths, and cycles.

* __Big-$O$ notation:__ $O,o,\Omega,\omega,\Theta$ notation for analyzing asymptotic growth of functions.

* __Discrete probability:__ Later on in we will use _probability theory_, and specifically probability over _finite_ samples spaces such as tossing $n$ coins, including notions such as _random variables_, _expectation_, and _concentration_.  We will only use  probability theory in the second half of this text, and will review it  beforehand. However, probabilistic reasoning is a subtle (and extremely useful!) skill, and it's always good to start early in acquiring it.


In the rest of this chapter we briefly review the above notions.
This is partially to remind the reader and reinforce material that might not be fresh in your mind, and partially to introduce our notation and conventions which might occasionally differ from those you've encountered before.



## Reading mathematical texts

Mathematical texts, such as this book, can often be intimidating at first, as they use a lot of mathematical jargon that can seem dense and confusing to the uninitiated.
Mathematicians use jargon for the same reason that it is used in many other professions such engineering, law, medicine, etc.
We want to make terms _precise_ and introduce shorthand for concepts that are frequently reused.
Mathematical text tends to "pack a lot of punch" per sentence, and so the key is to read it slowly and carefully, parsing each symbol at a time.

The basic components of a mathematical text are:

* __Definitions:__  Mathematicians always define new concepts in terms of old concepts.  Here is an example of a definition:

> # {.definition title="Perfect Square" #perfectsquaredef}
A natural number $n$ is  a _perfect square_ if there exists a natural number $k$ such that $n = k\cdot k$.

[perfectsquaredef](){.ref} uses the concept  of a natural number, and the concept of multiplication, to define the new term "perfect square".

When you see a new definition or concept, always ask yourself the following questions:

1. What is the intuitive notion that this definition aims at modeling?

2. How is the new concept  defined in terms of other concepts?

3. Which of these prior concepts am I already familiar with, and which ones do I still need to look up?

4. Can I come up with examples of objects that satisfy this definition? and examples of objects that do not?

As you read through the rest of this chapter and this text, try to ask yourself  the questions 1-4 above every time that you encounter a new definition.


::: { .pause }
You can try this out for the definition of a "perfect square". Can you come up with examples of numbers that are perfect squares, and examples of numbers that are not perfect squares? How do you _prove_ that a number is _not_ a perfect square.

You can also try to consider more refined questions such as finding out if there exists a perfect square that is the sum of two other perfect squares. You can also try to see how you would define notions such as being a "perfect cube". (Can you try to think if  there is a perfect cube which is the sum of two other perfect cubes?)
:::


* __Theorems, lemmas, claims:__ These are true statements about the concepts that we defined. For example, here is a true statement:

> # {.lemma #perfectsquarelem}
For every perfect square $a$ and perfect square $b$, $a\cdot b$ is a perfect square.

Deciding whether to call a particular statement a "Theorem", a "Lemma" or a "Claim" is a judgement call, and does not make a mathematical difference. All three correspond to true statements which can be proven. The difference is that a _Theorem_ refers to a significant result, that we would want to remember and highlight.  A _Lemma_ often refers to a  technical result, that is not necessarily important in its own right, but can be often very useful in proving other theorems. A _Claim_ is a "throw away" statement, that we need to use in order to prove some other bigger results, but do not care so much about for its own sake.



* __Proofs:__ These are the justifications that demonstrates that our theorems. We discuss proofs more in [proofsbackgroundsec](){.ref} below, but the mathematical standard of proof is very high. Namely we need an "airtight" argument that demonstrates that the statement is true beyond a shadow of a doubt.
For example, just checking that [perfectsquarelam](){.ref} is true for the $a=25$ and $b=4$ (in which case $a\cdot b  =100$ is indeed a perfect square) doesn't cut it. In contrast, here is a valid proof for [perfectsquarelam](){.ref}:


::: {.proof data-ref="perfectsquarelem"}
Let $a$ and $b$ be perfect squares. Then by the definition of a perfect square, there exist natural numbers $a',b'$ such that $a=a' \cdot a'$ and $b= b' \cdot b'$.
Define $c = a\cdot b$. Then by the above

$$
c = (a' \cdot a')\cdot(b' \cdot b') = (a' \cdot b') \cdot (a' \cdot b') \label{eqcommutativeperfectsquare}
$$
.^[The last inequality follows from the associativity and commutativity of multiplication; i.e., the fact that $(x \cdot y) \cdot z = x\cdot (y \cdot z)$ and $x\cdot y = y \cdot x$ for every numbers $x,y,z$). These are the kind of properties that in a course of this level we can assume that the reader knows and can "fill in the blank", and hence do not need to state explicitly. However, if you have any doubt, always err on the side of supplying more, rather than less, detail.]

Since $a',b'$ are natural numbers, $c' = a'\cdot b'$ is a natural number as well and hence [eqcommutativeperfectsquare](){.eqref} implies that $c = c' \cdot c'$ is a perfect square.
:::

As mentioned in the preface, as a general rule, it is more important you understand the  __definitions__ than the __theorems__, and it is more important you understand  a __theorem statement__  than its __proof__.


Dealing with mathematical text is in many ways not so different from dealing with any other complex text, whether it's a legal argument, a philosophical treatise, an English Renaissance play, or even the source code of an operating system.
You should not expect it to be clear in a first reading, but you need not despair.
Rather you should engage with the text, trying to figure out both the high level intentions as well as the underlying details.
Luckily, compared to philosophers or even programmers, mathematicians have a greater discipline of introducing definitions in linear order,  making sure that every new concept is defined only in terms of  previously defined notions.

### Example: Defining a one to one function

Here is a mathematical definition which you may have encountered in the past (and will encounter again shortly):


> # {.definition title="One to one function" #onetoonedef}
A function $f:S \rightarrow T$ is _one to one_ if for every two elements $x,x' \in S$, if $x \neq x'$ then  $f(x) \neq f(x')$.

This definition captures a simple concept, but even so it uses quite a bit of notation.
When reading this definition, or any other piece of mathematical text, it is often useful to annotate it with a pen as you're going through it, as in [onetoonedefannotatedef](){.ref}.
For every identifier you encounter (for example $f,S,T,x,x'$ in this case), make sure that you realize what sort of object is it: is it a set, a function, an element, a number, a gremlin?
Make sure you understand how  the identifiers are _quantified_.
For example, in [onetoonedef](){.ref} there is a _universal_ or "for all" (sometimes denotes by $\forall$) quantifier over pairs $(x,x')$ of distinct elements in $S$.
Finally, and most importantly, make sure that aside from being able to parse the definition formally, you also have an intuitive understanding of what is it that the text  is actually saying.
For example, [onetoonedef](){.ref} says that a one to one function is a function where every output is obtained by a unique input.



![An annotated form of [onetoonedef](){.ref}, marking which type is every object, and with a doodle explaining what the definition says.](../figure/onetoonedef.png){#onetoonedefannotatedef .class width=300px height=300px}

Reading mathematical texts in this way takes time, but it gets easier with practice.
Moreover, this is one of the most transferable skills you could take from this course.
Our world is changing rapidly, not just in the realm of technology, but also in many other human endeavors, whether it is medicine, economics, law or even culture.
Whatever your future aspirations, it is likely that you will encounter texts that use new concepts that you have not seen before (for semi-random recent examples from current "hot areas", see [alphagozerofig](){.ref} and [zerocashfig](){.ref}).
Being able to internalize and then apply new definitions can be hugely important.
It is a skill that's much easier to acquire in the relatively safe and stable  context of a mathematical course, where one at least has  the guarantee that the concepts are fully specified, and you have access to your teaching staff for questions.

## Basic discrete math objects

We now quickly review some of the mathematical objects (the "basic data structures" of mathematics, if you will) we use  in this course.

### Sets

A _set_ is an unordered collection of objects.
For example, when we write $S = \{ 2,4, 7 \}$, we mean that $S$ denotes the set that contains the numbers $2$, $4$, and $7$.
(We use the notation "$2 \in S$" to denote that $2$ is an element of $S$.)
Note that the set $\{ 2, 4, 7 \}$ and $\{ 7 , 4, 2 \}$ are identical, since they contain the same elements.
Also, a set either contains an element or does not contain it -- there is no notion of containing it  "twice" -- and so we could even write the same set $S$ as  $\{ 2, 2, 4, 7\}$ (though that would be a little weird).
The _cardinality_ of a finite set $S$, denoted by $|S|$, is the number of  elements it contains.^[Later in this course we  will discuss how to extend the notion of cardinality to _infinite_ sets.]
So, in the example above, $|S|=3$.
A set $S$ is a _subset_ of a set $T$, denoted by $S \subseteq T$, if every element of $S$ is also an element of $T$. (We can also describe this by saying that  $T$ is a _superset_ of $S$.)
For example, $\{2,7\} \subseteq \{ 2,4,7\}$.
The set that contains no elements is known as the _empty set_ and it is denoted by $\emptyset$.


We can define sets by either listing all their elements or by writing down a rule that they satisfy such as
$$
\text{EVEN} = \{ x  \;:\; \text{ $x=2y$ for some non-negative integer $y$} \} \;.
$$

Of course there is more than one way to write the same set, and often we will use intuitive notation listing a few examples that illustrate the rule.
For example,  we can also define $\text{EVEN}$ as

$$
\text{EVEN} = \{ 0,2,4, \ldots \} \;.
$$

Note that a set can be either finite  (such as the set $\{2,4,7\}$ ) or infinite (such as the set $\text{EVEN}$).
Also, the elements of a set don't have to be numbers.
We can talk about the sets such as the set $\{a,e,i,o,u \}$ of all the vowels in the English language, or the  set $\{$ `New York`, `Los Angeles`, `Chicago`, `Houston`, `Philadelphia`, `Phoenix`, `San Antonio`, `San Diego`, `Dallas` $\}$  of all cities in the U.S. with population more than  one million  per the 2010 census.
A set can even have other sets as elements, such as the set $\{ \emptyset, \{1,2\},\{2,3\},\{1,3\} \}$ of all even-sized subsets of $\{1,2,3\}$.

__Operations on sets:__ The _union_ of two sets $S,T$, denoted by $S \cup T$, is the set that contains all elements that are either in $S$ _or_ in $T$. The _intersection_ of $S$ and $T$, denoted by $S \cap T$, is the set of elements that are both in $S$ _and_ in $T$. The _set difference_ of $S$ and $T$, denoted by $S \setminus T$ (and in some texts  also by $S-T$), is the set of elements that are in $S$ but _not_ in $T$.

__Tuples, lists, strings, sequences:__ A _tuple_ is an _ordered_ collection of items. For example $(1,5,2,1)$ is a tuple with four elements (also known as a $4$-tuple or quadruple).
Since order matters, this is not the same tuple as the $4$-tuple $(1,1,5,2)$ or the $3$-tuple $(1,5,2)$. A $2$-tuple is also known as a _pair_.
We use the terms _tuples_ and _lists_ interchangeably.
A tuple where every element comes from some finite set $\Sigma$ (such as $\{0,1\}$) is also known as a _string_.
Analogously to sets, we denote the _length_ of a tuple $T$ by $|T|$.
Just like sets, we can also think of infinite analogues of tuples, such as the ordered collection $(1,2,4,9,\ldots )$ of all perfect squares.
Infinite ordered collections are known as _sequences_; we might sometimes use the term "infinite sequence" to emphasize this, and use "finite sequence" as a synonym for a tuple.^[We can identify a sequence $(a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots)$ of elements in some set $S$ with a _function_ $A:\N \rightarrow S$ (where $a_n = A(n)$ for every $n\in \N$). Similarly, we can identify a $k$-tuple $(a_0,\ldots,a_{k-1})$ of elements in $S$ with a function $A:[k] \rightarrow S$.]


__Cartesian product:__ If $S$ and $T$ are sets, then their _Cartesian product_, denoted by $S \times T$, is the set of all ordered pairs $(s,t)$ where $s\in S$ and $t\in T$.
For example, if $S = \{1,2,3 \}$ and $T = \{10,12 \}$, then $S\times T$ contains the $6$ elements $(1,10),(2,10),(3,10),(1,12),(2,12),(3,12)$.
Similarly if $S,T,U$ are sets then $S\times T \times U$ is the set of all ordered triples $(s,t,u)$ where $s\in S$, $t\in T$, and $u\in U$.
More generally, for every positive integer $n$ and sets $S_0,\ldots,S_{n-1}$, we denote by $S_0 \times S_1 \times \cdots \times S_{n-1}$ the set of ordered $n$-tuples $(s_0,\ldots,s_{n-1})$ where $s_i\in S_i$ for every $i \in \{0,\ldots, n-1\}$.
For every set $S$, we  denote the set $S\times S$ by $S^2$, $S\times S\times S$ by $S^3$, $S\times S\times S \times S$ by $S^4$, and so on and so forth.

### Sets in Python (optional)

To get more comfortable with sets, one can also play with the `set` data structure in Python:^[The `set` data structure only corresponds to _finite_ sets; infinite sets are much  more cumbersome to handle in programming languages, though mechanisms such as [Python generators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators) and [lazy evaluation](https://goo.gl/EJV4L3) in general can be helpful.]

```python
A = { 7 , 10 , 12}
B = {12 , 8 , 5 }
print(A==B)
# False
print(A=={10,7,7,12})
# True

def intersect(S,T):
    return {x for x in S if x in T}

print(intersect(A,B))
# {12}

def contains(S,T):
    return all({x in T for x in S})

print(contains(A,B))
# False

print(contains({2,8,8,12},{12,8,2,34}))
# True

def product(S,T):
    return {(s,t) for s in  S for t in  T}

print(product(A,B))
# {(10, 8), (10, 5), (7, 12), (12, 12), (10, 12), (12, 5), (7, 5), (7, 8), (12, 8)}
```


### Special sets { #specialsets }

There are several sets that we will use in this course time and again, and so find it useful to introduce explicit notation for them.
For starters we define

$$
\N = \{ 0, 1,2, \ldots \}
$$
to be the set of all _natural numbers_, i.e., non-negative integers.
For any natural number $n$, we define the set $[n]$ as $\{0,\ldots, n-1\} = \{ k\in \N : k < n \}$.^[We start our indexing of both $\N$ and $[n]$ from $0$, while many other  texts index  those sets from $1$. Starting from zero or one is simply a convention that doesn't make much difference, as long as one is consistent about it.]

We will also occasionally use the set $\Z=\{\ldots,-2,-1,0,+1,+2,\ldots \}$ of (negative and non-negative) _integers_,^[The letter Z stands for the German word "Zahlen", which means _numbers_.] as well as the set $\R$ of _real_ numbers. (This is the set that includes not just the integers, but also fractional and even irrational numbers; e.g., $\R$ contains numbers  such as $+0.5$, $-\pi$, etc.)
We denote by $\R_+$  the set $\{ x\in \R : x > 0 \}$ of _positive_  real numbers.
This set is sometimes also denoted as $(0,\infty)$.

__Strings:__ Another set we will use time and again is

$$
\{0,1\}^n = \{ (x_0,\ldots,x_{n-1}) \;:\; x_0,\ldots,x_{n-1} \in \{0,1\}  \}
$$
which is the set of all $n$-length binary strings for some natural number $n$.
That is $\{0,1\}^n$ is the set of all $n$-tuples  of zeroes and ones.
This is consistent with our notation above: $\{0,1\}^2$ is the Cartesian product $\{0,1\} \times \{0,1\}$, $\{0,1\}^3$ is the product $\{0,1\} \times \{0,1\} \times \{0,1\}$ and so on.


We  will write the string $(x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1})$ as simply $x_0x_1\cdots x_{n-1}$ and so for example

$$
\{0,1\}^3 = \{ 000 , 001, 010 , 011, 100, 101, 110, 111 \} \;.
$$

For every string $x\in \{0,1\}^n$ and $i\in [n]$, we write $x_i$ for the $i^{th}$ coordinate of $x$.
If $x$ and $y$ are strings, then $xy$  denotes their _concatenation_.
That is, if $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ and $y\in \{0,1\}^m$, then $xy$ is equal to the string $z\in \{0,1\}^{n+m}$ such that for $i\in [n]$, $z_i=x_i$ and for $i\in \{n,\ldots,n+m-1\}$, $z_i = y_{i-n}$.

We will also often talk about the set of binary strings of _all_ lengths, which is

$$
\{0,1\}^* = \{ (x_0,\ldots,x_{n-1}) \;:\; n\in\N \;,\;, x_0,\ldots,x_{n-1} \in \{0,1\} \} \;.
$$

Another way to write this set is as
$$
\{0,1\}^* = \{0,1\}^0 \cup \{0,1\}^1 \cup \{0,1\}^2 \cup \cdots
$$
or more concisely as

$$
\{0,1\}^* = \cup_{n\in\N} \{0,1\}^n \;.
$$

The set $\{0,1\}^*$ contains also the "string of length $0$" or "the empty string", which we will denote by $\mathtt{""}$.^[In using this notation we follow the convention of many  programming languages. Other texts sometimes use $\epsilon$ or $\lambda$ to denote the empty string. However, this doesn't matter much since we will rarely encounter this "edge case".]


__Generalizing the star operation:__ For every set $\Sigma$, we define

$$\Sigma^* = \cup_{n\in \N} \Sigma^n \;.$$
For example, if $\Sigma = \{a,b,c,d,\ldots,z \}$ then $\Sigma^*$ denotes the set of all finite length strings over the alphabet a-z.

__Concatenation:__ As mentioned in [specialsets](){.ref}, the _concatenation_ of two strings $x\in \Sigma^n$ and $y\in \Sigma^m$ is the $(n+m)$-length string $xy$ obtained by writing $y$ after $x$.


### Functions {#functionsec }

If $S$ and $T$ are nonempty sets, a _function_ $F$ mapping $S$ to $T$, denoted by $F:S \rightarrow T$, associates with every element $x\in S$ an element $F(x)\in T$.
The set $S$ is known as the _domain_ of $F$ and the set $T$ is known as the  _codomain_ of $F$.
The _image_ of a function $F$ is the set $\{ F(x) \;|\; x\in S\}$ which is the subset of $F$'s codomain consisting of all  output elements that are mapped from some input.^[Some texts use _range_ to denote the image of a function, while other texts use _range_ to denote the codomain of a function. Hence we will avoid using the term "range" altogether.]
Just as with sets, we can write a function either by listing the table of all the values it gives for elements in $S$ or using a rule.
For example if $S = \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 \}$ and $T = \{0,1 \}$, then the table below defines a function $F: S \rightarrow T$.
Note that this function is the same as the function defined by the rule $F(x)= (x \mod 2)$.^[For two natural numbers $x$ and $a$, $x \mod a$ (where $\mod$ is shorthand for ["modulo"](https://goo.gl/b7Fdzm)) denotes the _remainder_ of $x$ when it is divided by $a$. That is, it is the number $r$ in $\{0,\ldots,a-1\}$ such that $x = ak +r$ for some integer $k$. We sometimes also use the notation $x = y (\mod a)$ to denote the assertion that $x \mod a$ is the same as $y \mod a$.]

| Input | Output |
|:------|:-------|
| 0     | 0      |
| 1     | 1      |
| 2     | 0      |
| 3     | 1      |
| 4     | 0      |
| 5     | 1      |
| 6     | 0      |
| 7     | 1      |
| 8     | 0      |
| 9     | 1      |

\



If $F:S \rightarrow T$ satisfies that $F(x)\neq F(y)$ for all $x \neq y$ then we say that $F$ is _one-to-one_ (also known as an _injective_ function or simply an _injection_).
If $F$ satisfies that for every $y\in T$ there is some $x\in S$ such that $F(x)=y$ then we say that $F$ is _onto_ (also known as a _surjective_ function or simply a _surjection_).
A  function that is both one-to-one and onto is known as a _bijective_ function or simply a _bijection_.
A bijection from a set $S$ to itself is also known as a _permutation_ of $S$.
If  $F:S \rightarrow T$ is a bijection  then  for every $y\in T$ there is a unique $x\in S$ s.t. $F(x)=y$.
We denote this value $x$ by $F^{-1}(y)$.
Note that $F^{-1}$ is itself a bijection from $T$ to $S$ (can you see why?).


Giving a bijection between two sets is often a good way to show they have  the same size.
In fact, the standard mathematical definition of the notion that "$S$ and $T$ have the same cardinality" is that there exists a bijection $f:S \rightarrow T$.
In particular, the cardinality of a set $S$ is defined to be $n$ if there is a bijection from $S$ to the set $\{0,\ldots,n-1\}$.
As we will see later in this course, this is a definition that can  generalizes to defining the cardinality of _infinite_ sets.



__Partial functions:__ We will sometimes be interested in _partial_ functions from $S$ to $T$.
A partial function is allowed to be undefined on some subset of $S$.
That is, if $F$ is a partial function from $S$ to $T$, then for every $s\in S$, either there is (as in the case of standard functions) an element $F(s)$ in $T$, or $F(s)$ is undefined.
For example, the partial function $F(x)= \sqrt{x}$ is only defined on non-negative real numbers.
When we want to distinguish between partial functions and  standard (i.e., non-partial) functions, we will call the latter _total_ functions.
When we say "function" without any qualifier then we mean a _total_ function.

The notion of partial functions is a strict generalization of functions, and so every function is a partial function, but not every  partial function is a function. (That is, for every nonempty $S$ and $T$, the set of partial functions from $S$ to $T$ is a proper superset of the set of total functions from $S$ to $T$.) When we want to emphasize that a function $f$ from $A$ to $B$ might not be total, we will write $f: A \rightarrow_p B$.
We can think of a partial function $F$ from $S$ to $T$ also as a total function from $S$ to $T \cup \{ \bot \}$ where $\bot$ is some special "failure symbol", and so instead of saying that $F$ is undefined at $x$, we can say that $F(x)=\bot$.

__Basic facts about functions:__
Verifying that you can prove the following results is an excellent way to brush up on functions:

* If $F:S \rightarrow T$ and $G:T \rightarrow U$ are one-to-one functions, then their _composition_ $H:S \rightarrow U$ defined as $H(s)=G(F(s))$ is also one to one.

* If $F:S \rightarrow T$ is one to one, then there exists an onto function $G:T \rightarrow S$ such that $G(F(s))=s$ for every $s\in S$.

* If $G:T \rightarrow S$ is onto then there exists a one-to-one function $F:S \rightarrow T$ such that $G(F(s))=s$ for every $s\in S$.

* If $S$ and $T$ are finite sets then the following conditions are equivalent to one another: __(a)__ $|S| \leq |T|$, __(b)__ there is a one-to-one function $F:S \rightarrow T$, and __(c)__ there is an onto function $G:T \rightarrow S$.^[This is actually true even for _infinite_ $S$ and $T$: in that case __(b)__ is the commonly accepted _definition_ for $|S| \leq |T|$.]

![We can represent finite functions as a directed graph where we put an edge from $x$ to $f(x)$. The _onto_ condition corresponds to requiring that every vertex in the codomain of the function has in-degree _at least_ one. The _one-to-one_ condition  corresponds to requiring that every vertex in the codomain of the function has in-degree _at most_ one. In the examples above $F$ is an onto function, $G$ is one to one, and $H$ is neither onto nor one to one.](../figure/functionsdiagram.png){#functionsdiagrampng .class width=300px height=300px}

> # { .pause }
You can find the proofs of these results in many discrete math texts, including for example, section 4.5 in the [Leham-Leighton-Meyer notes](http://www.boazbarak.org/cs121/LLM_data_types.pdf).
However, I strongly suggest you try to prove them on your own, or at least convince yourself that they are true by proving special cases of those for small sizes (e.g., $|S|=3,|T|=4,|U|=5$).

Let us prove one of these facts as an example:

> # {.lemma #onetooneimpliesonto}
If $S,T$ are non-empty sets and $F:S \rightarrow T$ is one to one, then there exists an onto function $G:T \rightarrow S$ such that $G(F(s))=s$ for every $s\in S$.


> # {.proof data-ref="onetooneimpliesonto"}
Let $S$, $T$ and  $F:S \rightarrow T$ be as in the Lemma's statement, and choose some $s_0 \in S$.
We will define the function $G:T \rightarrow S$ as follows: for every $t\in T$, if there is some $s\in S$ such that $F(s)=t$ then set $G(t)=s$ (the choice of $s$ is well defined since by the one-to-one property of $F$, there cannot be two distinct $s,s'$  that both map to $t$).
Otherwise, set $G(t)=s_0$.
Now for every $s\in S$, by the definition of $G$, if $t=F(s)$ then $G(t)=G(F(s))=s$.
Moreover, this also shows that $G$ is _onto_, since it means that for every $s\in S$ there is some $t$ (namely $t=F(s)$) such that $G(t)=s$.



### Graphs { #graphsec }

_Graphs_ are ubiquitous in Computer Science, and  many other fields as well.
They are used to model a variety of data types including social networks, road networks, deep neural nets, gene interactions, correlations between observations, and a great many more.
The formal definitions of graphs are below, but if you have not encountered them before then I urge you to read up on them in one of the sources linked above.
Graphs come in two basic flavors: _undirected_ and _directed_.^[It is possible, and sometimes useful, to think of an undirected graph as simply a  directed graph with  the special property that for every pair $u,v$ either both the edges $\overrightarrow{u v}$ and $\overleftarrow{u v}$ are present or neither of them is. However, in many settings there is  a significant difference between  undirected and directed graphs, and so it's typically best to think of them as separate categories.]

![An example of an undirected and a directed graph. The undirected graph has vertex set $\{1,2,3,4\}$ and edge set $\{ \{1,2\},\{2,3\},\{2,4\} \}$. The directed graph has vertex set $\{a,b,c\}$ and the edge set $\{ (a,b),(b,c),(c,a),(a,c) \}$.](../figure/graphsexampe.png){#graphsexampefig .class width=300px height=300px}


> # {.definition title="Undirected graphs" #undirgraph}
An _undirected graph_ $G = (V,E)$ consists of a set $V$ of _vertices_ and a set $E$ of edges.
Every edge is a size two subset of $V$.
We say that two vertices $u,v \in V$ are _neighbors_, denoted by $u \sim v$, if the edge $\{u,v\}$ is in $E$.

Given this definition, we can define several other properties of graphs and their vertices.
We define the _degree_ of $u$ to be the number of neighbors $u$ has.
A _path_ in the graph is a tuple $(u_0,\ldots,u_k) \in V^k$, for some $k>0$ such that $u_{i+1}$ is a neighbor of $u_i$ for every $i\in [k]$.
A _simple path_ is a path $(u_0,\ldots,u_{k-1})$ where all the $u_i$'s are distinct.
A _cycle_ is a path $(u_0,\ldots,u_k)$ where $u_0=u_{k}$.
We say that two vertices $u,v\in V$ are _connected_ if either $u=v$ or there is a path from $(u_0,\ldots,u_k)$ where $u_0=u$ and $u_k=v$.
We say that the graph $G$ is _connected_ if every  pair of vertices in it is connected.

Here are some basic facts about undirected graphs. We give some informal arguments below, but leave the full proofs as exercises. (The proofs can also be found in most basic texts on  graph theory.)

> # {.lemma #degreesegeslem}
In any undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges.

[degreesegeslem](){.ref} can be shown by seeing that every edge $\{ u,v\}$ contributes twice to the sum of the degrees (once for $u$ and the second time for $v$.)

> # {.lemma #conntranslem}
The connectivity relation is _transitive_, in the sense that if $u$ is connected to $v$, and $v$ is connected to $w$, then $u$ is connected to $w$.

[conntranslem](){.ref} can be shown by simply attaching a path of the form $(u,u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_{k-1},v)$ to a path of the form $(v,u'_1,\ldots,u'_{k'-1},w)$ to obtain the path $(u,u_1,\ldots,u_{k-1},v,u'_1,\ldots,u'_{k'-1},w)$ that connects $u$ to $w$.


> # {.lemma #simplepathlem}
For every undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and connected pair $u,v$, the shortest path from $u$ to $v$ is simple.
In particular, for every connected pair there exists a simple path that connects them.

[simplepathlem](){.ref} can be shown by "shortcutting" any non simple path of the form $(u,u_1,\ldots,u_{i-1},w,u_{i+1},\ldots,u_{j-1},w,u_{j+1},\ldots,u_{k-1},v)$ where the same vertex $w$ appears in both the $i$-th and $j$-position, to obtain the shorter path $(u,u_1,\ldots,u_{i-1},w,u_{j+1},\ldots,u_{k-1},v)$.

> # { .pause }
If you haven't seen these proofs before, it is indeed a great exercise to transform the above informal exercises into fully rigorous proofs.


> # {.definition title="Directed graphs" #directedgraphdef}
A _directed graph_ $G=(V,E)$ consists of a set $V$ and a set $E \subseteq V\times V$  of _ordered pairs_ of $V$. We denote the edge $(u,v)$ also as $\overrightarrow{u v}$.
If the edge $\overrightarrow{u v}$ is present in the graph then we say that $v$ is an _out-neighbor_ of $u$ and $u$ is an _in-neigbor_ of $v$.

A directed graph might contain both $\overrightarrow{u v}$ and $\overrightarrow{v u}$ in which case $u$ will be both an in-neighbor and an out-neighbor of $v$ and vice versa.
The _in-degree_ of $u$ is the number of in-neighbors it has, and the _out-degree_ of $v$ is the number of out-neighbors it has.
A _path_ in the graph is a tuple $(u_0,\ldots,u_k) \in V^k$, for some $k>0$ such that $u_{i+1}$ is an out-neighbor of $u_i$ for every $i\in [k]$.
As in the undirected case, a _simple path_ is a path $(u_0,\ldots,u_{k-1})$ where all the $u_i$'s are distinct and a  _cycle_ is a path $(u_0,\ldots,u_k)$ where $u_0=u_{k}$.
One type of directed graphs we often care about is _directed acyclic graphs_ or _DAGs_, which, as their name implies, are directed graphs without any cycles.

The lemmas we mentioned above have analogs for directed graphs.
We again leave the proofs (which are essentially identical to their undirected analogs) as exercises for the reader:

> # {.lemma #diredgreesegeslem}
In any directed graph $G=(V,E)$, the sum of the in-degrees  is equal to the sum of the out-degrees, which is equal to the number of edges.


> # {.lemma #dirconntranslem}
In any directed graph $G$, if there is a path from $u$ to $v$ and a path from $v$ to $w$, then there is a path from $u$ to $w$.


> # {.lemma #dirsimplepathlem}
For every directed graph $G=(V,E)$ and a  pair $u,v$ such that there is a path from $u$ to $v$, the _shortest path_ from $u$ to $v$ is simple.


> # {.remark title="Graph terminology" #graphsname}
The word _graph_ in the sense above was coined by the mathematician Sylvester in 1878 in analogy with the chemical graphs used to visualize molecules.
There is an unfortunate confusion with the more common usage of the term as a way to plot  data, and in particular a plot of some function $f(x)$ as a function of $x$.
We can merge these two meanings by thinking of a function $f:A \rightarrow B$ as a special case of a directed graph over the vertex set $V= A \cup B$ where we put the edge $\overrightarrow{x f(x)}$ for every $x\in A$.
In a graph constructed in this way every vertex in $A$ has out-degree one.

The following [lecture of Berkeley CS70](http://www.eecs70.org/static/notes/n5.html) provides an excellent overview of graph theory.


### Logic operators and quantifiers.

If $P$ and $Q$ are some statements that can be true or false, then $P$ AND $Q$ (denoted as $P \wedge Q$) is the statement that is true if and only if both $P$ _and_ $Q$ are true, and $P$ OR $Q$ (denoted as $P \vee Q$) is the statement that is true if and only if either $P$ _or_ $Q$ is true.
The _negation_ of $P$, denoted as $\neg P$ or $\overline{P}$, is the statement that is true if and only if $P$ is false.

Suppose that $P(x)$ is a statement that depends on some _parameter_  $x$ (also sometimes known as an _unbound_ variable) in the sense that for every instantiation of $x$ with a value from some set $S$, $P(x)$ is either true or false.
For example, $x>7$ is a statement that is not a priori true or false, but does become true or false whenever we instantiate $x$ with some real number.
In such case we denote by  $\forall_{x\in S} P(x)$  the statement that is true if and only if $P(x)$ is true _for every_ $x\in S$.^[In these notes we will place the variable that is bound by a quantifier in a subscript and so write $\forall_{x\in S}P(x)$ whereas other texts might use $\forall x\in S. P(x)$.]
We denote by  $\exists_{x\in S} P(x)$  the statement that is true if and only if _there exists_ some $x\in S$ such that $P(x)$ is true.

For example, the following is a formalization of the true statement that there exists a natural number $n$ larger than $100$ that is not divisible by $3$:

$$
\exists_{n\in \N} (n>100) \wedge \left(\forall_{k\in N} k+k+k \neq n\right) \;.
$$

_"For sufficiently large $n$"_ One expression which comes up time and again is the claim that some statement $P(n)$ is true "for sufficiently large $n$".
What this means is that there exists an integer $N_0$ such that $P(n)$ is true for every $n>N_0$.
We can formalize this as $\exists_{N_0\in \N} \forall_{n>N_0} P(n)$.



### Quantifiers for summations and products { #secquantifiers }

The following shorthands for summing up or taking products of several numbers are often convenient.
If $S = \{s_0,\ldots,s_{n-1} \}$ is a finite set and  $f:S \rightarrow \R$ is a function, then we write $\sum_{x\in S} f(x)$ as shorthand for

$$
f(s_0) + f(s_1) + f(s_2) + \ldots + f(s_{n-1}) \;,
$$

and $\prod_{x\in S} f(x)$ as shorthand for

$$
f(s_0) \cdot f(s_1) \cdot f(s_2) \cdot \ldots \cdot f(s_{n-1}) \;.
$$

For example, the sum of the squares of all numbers from $1$ to $100$ can be written as

$$
\sum_{i\in \{1,\ldots,100\}} i^2 \;. \label{eqsumsquarehundred}
$$

Since summing up over intervals of integers is so common, there is  a special notation for it, and for every two integers $a \leq b$,  $\sum_{i=a}^b f(i)$ denotes $\sum_{i\in S} f(i)$ where $S =\{ x\in \Z : a \leq x \leq b \}$.
Hence we can write the sum [eqsumsquarehundred](){.eqref} as

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{100} i^2 \;.
$$

### Parsing formulas: bound and free variables {#boundvarsec }

In mathematics, as in coding, we often have symbolic "variables" or "parameters".
It is important to be able to understand, given some formula, whether a given variable is _bound_ or _free_ in this formula.
For example, in the following statement $n$ is free but $a$ and $b$ are bound by the $\exists$ quantifier:

$$
\exists_{a,b \in \N} (a \neq 1) \wedge (a \neq n) \wedge (n = a \times b) \label{aboutnstmt}
$$

Since $n$ is free, it can be set to any value, and the truth of the statement [aboutnstmt](){.eqref} depends on the value of $n$.
For example, if $n=8$ then [aboutnstmt](){.eqref} is true, but for $n=11$ it is false. (Can you see why?)

The same issue appears when parsing code.
For example, in the following snippet from the C++ programming language


```clang
for (int i=0 ; i<n ; i=i+1) {
    printf("*");
}
```
the variable `i` is bound to the `for` operator but the variable `n` is free.

The main property of bound variables is that we can change them to a different name (as long as it doesn't conflict with another used variable)  without changing the meaning of the statement.
Thus for example the statement


$$
\exists_{x,y \in \N} (x \neq 1) \wedge (x \neq n) \wedge (n = x \times y) \label{aboutnstmttwo}
$$
is equivalent to [aboutnstmt](){.eqref} in the sense that it is true for exactly the same set of $n$'s. Similarly, the code

```clang
for (int j=0 ; j<n ; j=j+1) {
    printf("*");
}
```

produces the same result as the code above that used `i` instead of `j`.

> # {.remark title="Aside: mathematical vs programming notation" #notation}
Mathematical notation has a lot of similarities with programming language, and for the same reasons.
Both are formalisms meant to convey complex concepts in a precise way.
However, there are some cultural differences.
In programming languages, we often try to use meaningful variable names such as `NumberOfVertices` while in math we often use short identifiers such as $n$.
(Part of it might have to do with the tradition of mathematical proofs as being handwritten and verbally presented, as opposed to typed up and compiled.)
>
One consequence of that is that in mathematics we often end up reusing identifiers, and also "run out" of letters and hence use Greek letters too, as well as distinguish between small and capital letters.
Similarly, mathematical notation tends to use quite a lot of "overloading", using operators such as $+$ for a great variety of objects (e.g., real numbers, matrices, finite field elements, etc..), and assuming that the meaning can be inferred from the context.
>
Both fields have a notion of "types", and in math we often try to reserve certain letters for variables of a particular type.
For example, variables such as $i,j,k,\ell,m,n$ will often denote integers, and $\epsilon$ will often denote a small positive real number.
When reading or writing mathematical texts, we usually don't have the advantage of a "compiler" that will check type safety for us. Hence it is important to keep track of the type of each variable, and see that the operations that are performed on it "make sense".


### Asymptotics and Big-$O$ notation

>_"$\log\log\log n$ has been proved to go to infinity, but has never been observed to do so."_, Anonymous, quoted by Carl Pomerance (2000)

It is often very cumbersome to describe precisely  quantities such as running time and is also not needed, since we are typically mostly interested in the "higher order terms".
That is, we want to understand the _scaling behavior_ of the quantity as the input variable grows.
For example, as far as running time goes, the difference between an $n^5$-time algorithm and an $n^2$-time one is much more significant than the difference between an $100n^2 + 10n$ time algorithm and an $10n^2$ time algorithm.
For this purpose, $O$-notation is extremely useful as a way to "declutter" our text and focus our attention on what really matters.
For example, using $O$-notation, we can say that both $100n^2 + 10n$ and $10n^2$ are simply $\Theta(n^2)$ (which informally means "the same up to constant factors"), while $n^2 = o(n^5)$ (which informally means that $n^2$ is "much smaller than" $n^5$).^[While Big-$O$ notation is often used to analyze running time of algorithms, this is by no means the only application. At the end of the day, Big-$O$ notation is just a way to express asymptotic inequalities between functions on integers. It can be used regardless of whether these functions are a measure of running time, memory usage, or any other quantity that may have nothing to do with computation.]


Generally (though still informally), if $F,G$ are two functions mapping natural numbers to non-negative reals,  then "$F=O(G)$" means that  $F(n) \leq G(n)$ if we don't care about constant factors, while  "$F=o(G)$" means that $F$ is much smaller than $G$, in the sense that no matter by what constant factor we multiply $F$, if we take $n$ to be large enough then  $G$ will be bigger (for this reason, sometimes $F=o(G)$ is written as $F \ll G$).
We will write $F= \Theta(G)$ if $F=O(G)$ and $G=O(F)$, which one can think of as saying that $F$ is the same as $G$ if we don't care about constant factors.
More formally, we define Big-$O$ notation as follows:


> # {.definition title="Big-$O$ notation" #bigohdef}
For $F,G: \N \rightarrow \R_+$, we define $F=O(G)$ if there exist numbers $a,N_0 \in \N$ such that $F(n) \leq a\cdot G(n)$ for every $n>N_0$.^[Recall that $\R_+$, which is also sometimes denoted as $(0,\infty)$, is the set of positive real numbers, so the above is just a way of saying that $F$ and $G$'s outputs are always positive numbers.]
We define $F=\Omega(G)$ if $G=O(F)$.
>
We write $F =o(G)$ if for every $\epsilon>0$ there is some $N_0$ such that $F(n) <\epsilon G(n)$ for every $n>N_0$.
We write $F =\omega(G)$ if $G=o(F)$.
We write $F= \Theta(G)$ if $F=O(G)$ and $G=O(F)$.


We can also use the notion of _limits_ to define Big- and Little-$O$ notation.
You can verify that $F=o(G)$ (or, equivalently, $G=\omega(F)$) if and only if $\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty} \tfrac{F(n)}{G(n)} = 0$.
Similarly, if the limit $\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty} \tfrac{F(n)}{G(n)}$ exists and is a finite number then $F=O(G)$.
If you are familiar with the notion of _supremum_, then you can verify that $F=O(G)$ if and only if $\limsup\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty} \tfrac{F(n)}{G(n)} < \infty$.

![If $F(n)=o(G(n))$ then for sufficiently large $n$, $F(n)$ will be smaller than $G(n)$. For example, if Algorithm $A$ runs in time $1000\cdot n+10^6$ and Algorithm $B$ runs in time $0.01\cdot n^2$ then even though $B$ might be more efficient for smaller inputs, when the inputs get sufficiently large, $A$ will run _much_ faster than $B$. ](../figure/nvsnsquared.png){#nvsnsquaredfig .class width=300px height=300px}



> # {.remark title="Big-$O$ and equality" #equalitybighohrem}
Using the equality sign for $O$-notation is extremely common, but is somewhat of a misnomer, since a statement such as $F = O(G)$ really means that $F$ is in the set $\{ G' : \exists_{N,c} \text{ s.t. } \forall_{n>N} G'(n) \leq c G(n) \}$.
For this reason, some texts write $F \in O(G)$ instead of $F = O(G)$.
If anything, it would have made more sense use _inequalities_ and  write $F \leq O(G)$ and $F \geq \Omega(G)$, reserving equality for $F = \Theta(G)$,  but by now the equality notation is quite firmly entrenched.
Nevertheless, you should remember that a statement such as $F = O(G)$ means that $F$ is "at most" $G$ in some rough sense when we ignore constants, and a statement such as $F = \Omega(G)$ means that $F$ is "at least" $G$ in the same rough sense.

It's often convenient to use "anonymous functions" in the context of $O$-notation, and also  to emphasize the input parameter to the function.
For example, when we write a statement such as $F(n) = O(n^3)$, we mean that  $F=O(G)$ where $G$ is the function defined by $G(n)=n^3$.
Chapter 7 in [Jim Apsnes' notes on discrete math](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/classes/202/notes.pdf) provides a good summary of $O$ notation; see also [this tutorial](http://discrete.gr/complexity/) for a gentler and more programmer-oriented introduction.



### Some "rules of thumb" for Big-$O$ notation

There are some simple heuristics that can help when trying to compare two functions $F$ and $G$:

* Multiplicative constants don't matter in $O$-notation, and so if $F(n)=O(G(n))$ then $100F(n)=O(G(n))$.

* When adding two functions, we only care about the larger one. For example, for the purpose of $O$-notation, $n^3+100n^2$ is the same as $n^3$, and in general in any polynomial, we only care about the larger exponent.

* For every two constants $a,b>0$, $n^a = O(n^b)$ if and only if $a \leq b$, and $n^a = o(n^b)$ if and only if $a<b$. For example, combining the two observations above, $100n^2 + 10n + 100 = o(n^3)$.

* Polynomial is always smaller than exponential: $n^a = o(2^{n^\epsilon})$ for every two constants $a>0$ and $\epsilon>0$ even if $\epsilon$ is much smaller than $a$. For example, $100n^{100} = o(2^{\sqrt{n}})$.

* Similarly, logarithmic is always smaller than polynomial: $(\log n)^a$ (which we write as $\log^a n$) is $o(n^\epsilon)$ for every two constants $a,\epsilon>0$. For example, combining the observations above, $100n^2 \log^{100} n = o(n^3)$.

In most (though not all!) cases we use $O$-notation, the constants hidden by it are not too huge and so on an intuitive level, you can think of $F=O(G)$ as saying something like $F(n) \leq 1000 G(n)$ and $F=\Omega(G)$ as saying something $F(n) \geq 0.001 G(n)$.


## Proofs { #proofsbackgroundsec }



Many people think of mathematical proofs as a sequence of logical deductions that starts from some axioms and ultimately arrives at a conclusion.
In fact, some dictionaries [define](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mathematical+proof) proofs that way.
This is not entirely wrong, but in reality a mathematical proof of a statement X is simply an argument that convinces the reader that X is true beyond a shadow of a doubt.
To produce such a proof you need to:

1. Understand precisely what X means.

2. Convince  _yourself_ that X is true.

3. Write your reasoning down in plain, precise and concise English (using formulas or notation only when they help clarity).

In many cases, Step 1 is the most important one. Understanding what a statement means is often more than halfway towards understanding why it is true.
In Step 3, to convince the reader beyond a shadow of a doubt, we will often want to  break down the reasoning to "basic steps", where each basic step is simple enough to be "self evident". The  combination of all steps yields the desired statement.

### Proofs and programs

There is a great deal of similarity between the process of writing _proofs_ and that of writing _programs_, and both require a similar set of skills.
Writing a _program_ involves:

1. Understanding what is the _task_ we want the program to achieve.

2. Convincing _yourself_ that the task can be achieved by a computer, perhaps by planning on a whiteboard or notepad how you will break it up to simpler tasks.

3. Converting this plan into code that a compiler or interpreter can understand, by breaking up each task into a sequence of the basic operations of some programming language.

In programs as in proofs, step 1 is often the most important one.
A key difference is that the reader for proofs is a human being and for programs is a compiler.^[This difference might be eroding with time, as more proofs are being written in a _machine verifiable form_ and progress in artificial intelligence allows expressing programs in more human friendly ways, such as "programming by example". Interestingly, much of the progress in automatic proof verification and proof assistants relies on a [much deeper correspondence](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf) between _proofs_ and _programs_. We _might_ see this correspondence later in this course.]
Thus our emphasis is on _readability_ and having a _clear logical flow_ for the proof (which is not a bad idea for programs as well...).
When writing a proof, you should think of your audience as an intelligent but highly skeptical and somewhat petty reader, that will "call foul" at every step that is not well justified.


## Extended example: graph connectivity

To illustrate these ideas, let us consider the following example of a true theorem:

> # {.theorem title="Minimum edges for connected graphs" #graphconthm}
Every connected undirected graph of $n$ vertices has at least $n-1$ edges.


We are going to take our time to understand how one would come up with a  proof for [graphconthm](){.ref}, and how to write such a proof down.
This will not be the shortest way to prove this theorem, but hopefully following this process will give you some general insights on  reading, writing, and discovering mathematical proofs.

Before trying to prove [graphconthm](){.ref},  we need to understand what it means.
Let's start with the terms in the theorems.
We defined undirected graphs and the notion of connectivity in [graphsec](){.ref} above.
In particular, an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ is _connected_ if for every pair $u,v \in V$, there is a path $(u_0,u_1,\ldots,u_k)$ such that $u_0=u$, $u_k=v$, and $\{ u_i,u_{i+1} \} \in E$ for every $i\in [k]$.

> # { .pause }
It is crucial that at this point you pause and verify that you completely understand the definition of connectivity. Indeed, you should make a habit of pausing after any statement of a theorem, even before looking at the proof, and verifying that you  understand all the terms that the theorem refers to.

To prove [graphconthm](){.ref} we need to show that there is no $2$-vertex connected graph with fewer than $1$ edges, $3$-vertex connected graph with fewer than $2$ edges, and so on and so forth.
One of the best ways to prove a theorem is to first try to _disprove it_.
By trying and failing to come up with a counterexample, we often understand why the theorem can not be false.
For example, if you try to draw a $4$-vertex graph with only two edges, you can see that there are basically only two  choices for such a graph as depicted in [figurefourvertexgraph](){.ref}, and in both there will remain some vertices that cannot be connected.


![In a four vertex graph with two edges, either both edges have a shared vertex or they don't. In both cases the graph will not be connected.](../figure/4graph2edge.png){#figurefourvertexgraph .class width=300px height=300px}

In fact, we can see that if we have a budget of $2$ edges and we choose some vertex $u$, we will not be able to connect to $u$ more than two other vertices, and similarly with a budget of $3$ edges we will not be able to connect to $u$ more than three other vertices.
We can keep trying to draw such examples until we convince ourselves that the theorem is probably true, at which point we want to see how we can _prove_ it.


> # { .pause }
If you have not seen the proof of this theorem before (or don't remember it), this would be an excellent point to pause and try to prove it yourself.
One way to do it would be to describe an _algorithm_ that on input a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and $n-2$ or fewer edges, finds a pair $u,v$ of vertices such that $u$ is disconnected from $v$.




### Mathematical induction

There are several ways to prove [graphconthm](){.ref}.
One approach to do is to start by proving it for small graphs, such as graphs with 2,3 or 4 edges, for which we can check all the cases, and then try to extend the proof for larger graphs.
The technical term for this proof approach is _proof by induction_.


_Induction_ is simply an application of the self-evident  [Modus Ponens rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens) that says that if __(a)__ $P$ is true and __(b)__ $P$ implies $Q$
then $Q$ is true.
In the setting of proofs by induction we typically have a statement $Q(k)$ that is parameterized by some integer $k$, and we prove that  __(a)__ $Q(0)$ is true and __(b)__ For every $k>0$, if $Q(0),\ldots,Q(k-1)$ are all true then $Q(k)$ is true.^[Usually proving __(b)__ is the hard part, though there are examples where the "base case" __(a)__ is quite subtle.]
By repeatedly applying Modus Ponens, we can deduce from __(a)__ and __(b)__ that $Q(1)$ is true, and then from __(a)__,__(b)__ and $Q(1)$ that $Q(2)$ is true, and so on and so forth to obtain that  $Q(k)$ is true for every $k$. The statement __(a)__ is called the "base case", while __(b)__ is called the "inductive step". The assumption in __(b)__ that $Q(i)$ holds for $i<k$ is called the "inductive hypothesis".

> # {.remark title="Induction and recursion" #inducrecrem}
Proofs by inductions are closely related to algorithms by recursion.
In both cases we reduce solving a larger problem to solving a smaller instance of itself. In a recursive algorithm to solve some problem P on an input of length $k$  we ask ourselves "what if someone handed me a way to solve P on instances smaller than $k$?". In an inductive proof to prove a statement Q parameterized by a number $k$, we ask ourselves "what if I already knew that $Q(k')$ is true for $k'<k$".
Both induction and recursion are crucial concepts for this course and Computer Science at large (and even other areas of inquiry, including not just mathematics but other sciences as well). Both can be initially (and even post-initially) confusing, but with time and practice they become clearer.
For more on proofs by induction and recursion, you might find the  following [Stanford CS 103 handout](https://cs121.boazbarak.org/StanfordCS103Induction.pdf), [this MIT 6.00 lecture](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/unit-1/lecture-6-recursion/) or [this excerpt of the Lehman-Leighton book](https://cs121.boazbarak.org/LL_induction.pdf) useful.




### Proving the theorem by induction

There are several ways to use induction to prove  [graphconthm](){.ref}.
We will do so by following our intuition above that with a budget of $k$ edges, we cannot connect to a vertex more than $k$ other vertices.
That is, we will define the statement $Q(k)$ as follows:

>$Q(k)$ is _"For every graph $G=(V,E)$ with at most $k$ edges and every $u\in V$, the number of vertices that are connected to $u$ (including $u$ itself) is at most $k+1$"_

Note that $Q(n-2)$ implies our theorem, since it means that in an $n$ vertex graph of $n-2$ edges, there would be at most $n-1$ vertices  that are connected to $u$, and hence in particular there would be _some_ vertex that is not connected to $u$.
More formally, if we define, given any undirected graph $G$ and vertex $u$ of $G$, the set $C_G(u)$ to contain all  vertices connected to $u$, then the statement $Q(k)$ is that for every undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $|E|=k$ and $u\in V$,  $|C_G(u)| \leq k+1$.

To prove that $Q(k)$ is true for every $k$ by induction, we will first prove  that __(a)__  $Q(0)$ is true, and then prove  __(b)__  if $Q(0),\ldots,Q(k-1)$ are true then $Q(k)$ is true as well.
In fact, we will prove the stronger statement __(b')__ that if $Q(k-1)$ is true then $Q(k)$ is true as well.
(__(b')__ is a stronger statement than __(b)__ because it has same conclusion with a weaker assumption.)
Thus, if we show both __(a)__ and __(b')__ then we complete the proof of [graphconthm](){.ref}.


Proving __(a)__  (i.e., the "base case") is actually quite easy. The statement $Q(0)$ says that if $G$ has zero edges, then $|C_G(u)|=1$, but this is clear because in a graph  with zero edges, $u$ is only connected to itself.
The heart of the proof is, as typical with induction proofs, is in proving a statement such as __(b')__ (or even the weaker statement __(b)__).
Since we are trying to prove an _implication_, we can _assume_ the so-called "inductive hypothesis" that $Q(k-1)$ is true  and need to prove from this assumption that $Q(k)$ is true.
So, suppose that $G=(V,E)$ is a graph of $k$ edges, and $u\in V$.
Since we can use induction, a natural approach would be to remove an edge $e\in E$ from the graph to create a new graph $G'$ of $k-1$ edges.
We can use the induction hypothesis to argue that $|C_{G'}(u)| \leq k$.
Now if we could only argue that removing the edge $e$ reduced the connected component of $u$ by at most a single vertex,  then we would be done, as we could argue that $|C_G(u)| \leq |C_{G'}(u)|+1 \leq k+1$.

> # { .pause }
Please ensure that you understand why showing that $|C_G(u)| \leq |C_{G'}(u)|+1$ completes the inductive proof.

![Removing a single edge $e$ can greatly decrease the number of vertices that are connected to a vertex $u$.](../figure/effectofoneedge.png){#effectofoneedgefig .class width=300px height=300px}

Alas, this might not be the case.
It could be that removing  a single edge $e$ will greatly reduce the size of $C_{G}(u)$.
For example that edge might be a "bridge" between two large connected components; such a situation is illustrated in  [effectofoneedgefig](){.ref}.
This might seem as a real stumbling block, and at this point we might go back to the drawing board to see if perhaps the theorem is false after all.
However, if we look at various concrete examples, we see that in any concrete example, there is always a "good" choice of an edge,  adding which will  increase the component connect to $u$ by at most one vertex.

![Removing an edge $e=\{s,w\}$ where $w\in C_G(u)$ has degree one removes only $w$ from $C_G(u)$. ](../figure/addingdegreeone.png){#addingdegreeonefig .class width=300px height=300px}

The crucial observation is that this always holds if we choose an edge  $e = \{ s, w\}$ where $w \in C_G(u)$ has degree one in the graph $G$, see [addingdegreeonefig](){.ref}.
The reason is simple.
Since every path from $u$ to $w$ must pass through $s$ (which is $w$'s only neighbor), removing the edge $\{ s,w \}$ merely has the effect of disconnecting $w$ from $u$, and hence $C_{G'}(u) = C_G(u) \setminus \{ w \}$ and in particular $|C_{G'}(u)|=|C_G(u)|-1$, which is exactly the condition we needed.

Now the question is whether there will always be a degree one vertex in $C_G(u) \setminus \{u \}$.
Of course generally we are not guaranteed that a graph would have a degree one vertex, but we are not dealing with a general graph here but rather a graph with a small number of edges.
We can assume that $|C_G(u)| > k+1$ (otherwise we're done) and each vertex in $C_G(u)$ must have degree at least one (as otherwise it would not be connected to $u$).
Thus, the only case where there is no vertex $w\in C_G(u) \setminus \{u\}$  of degree one, is when the degrees of all vertices in $C_G(u)$ are at least $2$.
But then by [degreesegeslem](){.ref} the number of edges in the graph is at least $\tfrac{1}{2}\cdot 2 \cdot (k+1)>k$, which contradicts our assumption that the graph $G$ has at most $k$ edges.
Thus we can conclude that either $|C_G(u)| \leq k+1$  (in which case we're done) or there is a degree one vertex $w\neq u$ that is connected to $u$.
By removing the single edge $e$ that touches $w$, we obtain a $k-1$ edge graph $G'$ which (by the inductive hypothesis) satisfies $|C_{G'}(u)| \leq k$, and hence $|C_G(u)|=|C_{G'}(u) \cup \{ w \}| \leq k+1$.
This suffices to complete an inductive proof of statement $Q(k)$.


### Writing down the proof

All of the above was a discussion of how we _discover_ the proof, and convince _ourselves_ that the statement is true.
However, once we do that, we still need to write it down.
When writing the proof,   we use the benefit of hindsight, and try to streamline what was a messy journey into a linear and easy-to-follow flow of logic that starts with the word __"Proof:"__ and ends with  __"QED"__ or the symbol $\blacksquare$.^[QED stands for "quod erat demonstrandum", which is "What was to be demonstrated." or  "The very thing it was required to have shown." in Latin.]
All our discussions, examples and digressions can be very insightful, but we keep them outside the space delimited between these two words, where (as described by this [excellent handout](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs103/handouts/120%20Proofwriting%20Checklist.pdf)) "every sentence must be load bearing".
Just like we do in programming, we can break the proof into little "subroutines" or "functions" (known as _lemmas_ or _claims_ in math language), which will be smaller statements that help us prove the main result.
However, it should always be crystal-clear to the reader in what stage we are of the proof.
Just like it should always be clear to which function a line of code belongs to, it should always be clear whether an individual sentence  is part of a  proof of some intermediate result, or is part of the argument showing that this intermediate result implies the theorem.
Sometimes we highlight this partition by noting after each occurrence of  __"QED"__ to which lemma or claim it belongs.


Let us see how the proof of [graphconthm](){.ref} looks in this streamlined fashion.
We start by repeating the theorem statement

> # {.theorem title="Minimum edges for connected graphs (restated)" #graphconthmpf}
Every connected undirected graph of $n$ vertices has at least $n-1$ edges.

> # {.proof data-ref="graphconthmpf"}
The proof will follow from the following lemma:
>
>> # {.lemma #graphcontlem}
>For every $k\in \N$, undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ of at most $k$ edges, and $u\in V$, the number of vertices connected to $u$ in $G$ is at most $k+1$.
>
>We start by showing that [graphcontlem](){.ref} implies the theorem:
>
>>__Proof of [graphconthmpf](){.ref} from [graphcontlem](){.ref}:__ We will show that for undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ of $n$ vertices and at most $n-2$ edges, there is a pair $u,v$ of vertices that are disconnected in $G$. let $G$ be such a graph and $u$ be some vertex of $G$. By [graphcontlem](){.ref}, the number of vertices connected to $u$ is at most $n-1$, and hence (since $|V|=n$) there is a vertex $v\in V$ that is not connected to $u$, thus completing the proof. __QED (Proof of [graphconthmpf](){.ref} from [graphcontlem](){.ref})__
>
>We now turn to proving [graphcontlem](){.ref}. Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph of $k$ edges and $u\in V$. We define $C_G(u)$ to be the set of vertices connected to $u$. To complete the proof of  [graphcontlem](){.ref}, we need to prove that $|C_G(u)| \leq k+1$. We will do so by induction on $k$.
>
>The _base_ case that $k=0$ is true because a graph with zero edges, $u$ is only connected to itself.
>
>Now suppose that [graphcontlem](){.ref} is true for $k-1$ and we will prove it for $k$.
>Let $G=(V,E)$ and $u\in V$ be as above, where $|E|=k$, and suppose (towards a contradiction) that $|C_G(u)| \geq k+2$. Let $S = C_G(u) \setminus \{u \}$.
Denote by $deg(v)$ the degree of any vertex $v$.
By [degreesegeslem](){.ref}, $\sum_{v\in S} deg(v) \leq \sum_{v\in V} deg(v) = 2|E|=2k$.
Hence in particular, under our assumption that $|S|+1=|C_G(u)| \geq k+2$, we get that $\tfrac{1}{|S|}\sum_{v\in S} deg(v) \leq 2k/(k+1)< 2$.
In other words, the _average_ degree of a vertex in $S$ is smaller than $2$, and hence in particular there is _some_ vertex $w\in S$ with degree smaller than $2$.
Since $w$ is connected to $u$, it must have degree at least one, and hence (since $w$'s degree is smaller than two) degree _exactly_ one.
In other words, $w$ has a single neighbor which we denote by $s$.
>
Let $G'$ be the graph obtained by removing the edge $\{ s, w\}$ from $G$.
Since $G'$ has at most $k-1$ edges, by the inductive hypothesis we can assume that $|C_{G'}(u)| \leq k$.
The proof of the lemma is concluded by showing the following claim:
>
>>__Claim:__ Under the above assumptions, $|C_G(u)| \leq |C_{G'}(u)|+1$.
>
>>__Proof of claim:__ The claim says that $C_{G'}(u)$ has at most one fewer element than $C_G(u)$. Thus it follows from the following statement $(*)$:  $C_{G'}(u) \supseteq C_G(u) \setminus \{ w \}$. To prove (*) we need to show that for every  $v \neq w$ that is connected to $u$, $v \in C_{G'}(u)$. Indeed for every such $v$,  [simplepathlem](){.ref} implies that  there must be some _simple_ path $(t_0,t_1,\ldots,t_{i-1},t_i)$ in the graph $G$ where $t_0=u$ and $t_i=v$. But $w$ cannot belong to this  path, since $w$ is different from the endpoints $u$ and $v$ of the path and can't equal one of the intermediate points either, since it has degree one and that would make the path not  simple. More formally, if  $w=t_j$ for $0 < j < i$, then  since $w$ has only a single neighbor $s$,  it would have to hold that $w$'s neighbor $s$ satisfies $s=t_{j-1}=t_{j+1}$, contradicting the simplicity of the path.
Hence the path from $u$ to $v$ is also a path in the graph $G'$, which means that $v \in C_{G'}(u)$, which is what we wanted to prove. __QED (claim)__
>
>The claim implies [graphcontlem](){.ref} since by the inductive assumption, $|C_{G'}(u)| \leq k$, and hence by the claim $|C_G(u)| \leq k+1$, which is what we wanted to prove. This concludes the proof of [graphcontlem](){.ref} and hence also of [graphconthmpf](){.ref}. __QED ([graphcontlem](){.ref})__, __QED ([graphconthmpf](){.ref})__


::: {.remark title="Averaging Principle" #averagingprinciplerem}
The proof above used the observation that if the _average_ of some $n$ numbers $x_0,\ldots,x_{n-1}$ is at most $X$, then there must _exists_ at least a single number $x_i \leq X$. (In this particular proof, the numbers were the degrees of vertices in $S$.)
This is known as the _averaging principle_, and despite its simplicity, it is often extremely useful.
:::

> # { .pause }
Reading a proof is no less of an important skill than producing one.
In fact, just like understanding code, it is a highly non-trivial skill in itself.
Therefore I strongly suggest that you re-read the above proof, asking yourself at every sentence whether the assumption it makes are justified, and whether this sentence truly demonstrates what it purports to achieve.
Another good habit is to ask yourself when reading a proof for every variable you encounter (such as $u$, $t_i$, $G'$, etc. in the above proof) the following questions: __(1)__ What _type_ of variable is it? is it a number? a graph? a vertex? a function? and __(2)__ What do we know about it? Is it an arbitrary member of the set? Have we shown some facts about it?, and __(3)__ What are we _trying_ to show about it?.



## Proof writing style

A mathematical proof is a piece of writing, but it is a specific genre of writing with certain conventions and preferred styles.
As in any writing, practice makes perfect, and it is also important to revise your drafts for clarity.

In a proof for the statement $X$, all the text between the words __"Proof:"__ and __"QED"__ should be focused on establishing that $X$ is true.
Digressions, examples, or ruminations should be kept outside these two words, so they do not confuse the reader.
The proof should have a clear logical flow in the sense that every sentence or equation in it should have some purpose and it should be crystal-clear to the reader what this purpose is.
When you write a proof, for every equation or sentence you include, ask yourself:

1. Is this sentence or equation stating that some statement is true?

2. If so, does this statement   follow from the previous steps,  or are we going to establish it in the next step?

3. What is the _role_ of this sentence  or equation? Is it one step towards proving the original statement, or is it a step towards proving some intermediate claim that you have stated before?

4. Finally, would the answers to questions 1-3 be clear to the reader? If not, then you should reorder, rephrase or add explanations.


Some helpful resources on mathematical writing include [this handout by Lee](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~lee/Writing/writing-proofs.pdf), [this handout by Hutching](https://math.berkeley.edu/~hutching/teach/proofs.pdf), as well as several of the excellent handouts in [Stanford's CS 103 class](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs103/).


### Patterns in proofs

>_"If it was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be; but as it isn셳, it ain셳. That셲 logic."_, Lewis Carroll, _Through the looking-glass_.


Just like in programming, there are several common patterns of proofs that occur time and again.
Here are some examples:

__Proofs by contradiction:__ One way to prove that $X$ is true is to show that if $X$ was false then we would get a contradiction as a result. Such proofs often start with a sentence such as "Suppose, towards a contradiction, that $X$ is false" and end with deriving some contradiction (such as a violation of one of the assumptions in the theorem statement).
Here is an example:

> # {.lemma }
There are no natural numbers $a,b$ such that $\sqrt{2} = \tfrac{a}{b}$.

> # {.proof }
Suppose, towards the sake of contradiction that this is false, and so let $a\in \N$ be the smallest number such that there exists some $b\in\N$ satisfying $\sqrt{2}=\tfrac{a}{b}$.
Squaring this equation we get that $2=a^2/b^2$ or $a^2=2b^2$ $(*)$. But this means that $a^2$ is _even_, and since the product of two odd  numbers is odd, it means that $a$ is even as well, or in other words, $a = 2a'$ for some $a' \in \N$. Yet plugging this into $(*)$ shows  that $4a'^2 = 2b^2$ which means  $b^2 = 2a'^2$ is an even number as well. By the same considerations as above we gat that $b$ is even and hence $a/2$ and $b/2$ are two natural numbers  satisfying $\tfrac{a/2}{b/2}=\sqrt{2}$, contradicting the minimality of $a$.


__Proofs of a universal statement:__ Often we want to prove a statement $X$ of the form "Every object of type $O$ has property $P$." Such proofs often start with a sentence such as "Let $o$ be an object of type $O$" and end by showing that $o$ has the property $P$.
Here is a simple example:

> # {.lemma }
For every natural number $n\in N$, either $n$ or $n+1$ is even.


> # {.proof}
Let $n\in N$ be some number.
If $n/2$ is a whole number then we are done, since then $n=2(n/2)$ and hence it is even.
Otherwise, $n/2+1/2$ is a whole number, and hence $2(n/2+1/2)=n+1$ is even.

__Proofs of an implication:__ Another common case is that the statement $X$ has the form "$A$ implies $B$". Such proofs often start with a sentence such as "Assume that $A$ is true" and end with a derivation of $B$ from $A$.
Here is a simple example:

> # {.lemma }
If $b^2 \geq 4ac$ then there is a solution to the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c =0$.

> # {.proof }
Suppose that $b^2 \geq 4ac$.
Then $d = b^2 - 4ac$ is a non-negative number and hence it has a square root $s$.
Thus $x = (-b+s)/(2a)$ satisfies
$$
\begin{aligned}
ax^2 + bx + c &= a(-b+s)^2/(4a^2) + b(-b+s)/(2a) + c \\
&= (b^2-2bs+s^2)/(4a)+(-b^2+bs)/(2a)+c \;. \label{eq:quadeq}
\end{aligned}
$$

Rearranging the terms of [eq:quadeq](){.eqref} we get
$$
s^2/(4a)+c- b^2/(4a) = (b^2-4ac)/(4a) + c - b^2/(4a) = 0
$$

__Proofs of equivalence:__  If a statement has the form "$A$  if and only if $B$" (often shortened as "$A$ iff $B$") then we need to prove both that $A$ implies $B$ and that $B$ implies $A$.
We call the implication that $A$ implies $B$ the "only if" direction, and the implication that $B$ implies $A$ the "if" direction.


__Proofs by combining intermediate claims:__
When a proof is more complex, it is often helpful to break it apart into several steps.
That is, to prove the statement $X$, we might first prove statements $X_1$,$X_2$, and $X_3$ and then prove that $X_1 \wedge X_2 \wedge X_3$ implies $X$.^[As mentioned below, $\wedge$ denotes the logical AND operator.]
Our proof of [graphconthm](){.ref} had this form.

__Proofs by case distinction:__ This is a special case of the above, where to prove a statement $X$ we split into several cases $C_1,\ldots,C_k$, and prove that __(a)__ the cases are _exhaustive_, in the sense that _one_ of the cases $C_i$  must happen and __(b)__ go one by one and prove that each one of the cases $C_i$ implies the result $X$ that we are after.

__"Without loss of generality (w.l.o.g)":__ This term can be initially quite confusing to students. It is essentially a way to shorten case distinctions such as the above. The idea is that if Case 1 is equal to Case 2 up to a change of variables or a similar transformation, then the proof of Case 1 will also imply the proof of case 2.
It is always a statement that should be viewed with suspicion.
Whenever you see it in a proof, ask yourself if you understand _why_ the assumption made is truly without loss of generality, and when you use it, try to see if the use is indeed justified.
Sometimes it might be easier to just repeat the proof of the second case (adding a remark that the proof is very similar to the first one).

__Proofs by induction:__ We can think of such proofs as a variant of the above, where we have an unbounded number of intermediate claims $X_0,X_2,\ldots,X_k$, and we prove that $X_0$ is true, as well that $X_0$ implies $X_1$, and that $X_0  \wedge X_1$ implies $X_2$, and so on and so forth.
The website for CMU course 15-251 contains a [useful handout](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./15251/notes/induction-pitfalls.pdf) on potential pitfalls when making proofs by induction.


::: {.remark title="Hierarchical Proofs (optional)" #lamportrem}
Mathematical proofs are ultimately written in English prose.
The well-known computer scientist [Leslie Lamport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport) argued that this is a problem, and proofs should be written in a more formal and rigorous way.
In his [manuscript](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/proof.pdf) he proposes an approach for _structured hierarchical proofs_, that have the following form:

* A proof for a statement of the form "If $A$ then $B$" is a sequence of numbered claims, starting with the assumption that $A$ is true, and ending with the claim that $B$ is true.

* Every claim is followed by a proof showing how it is derived from the previous assumptions or claims.

* The proof for each claim is itself a sequence of subclaims.

The advantage of Lamport's format is that it is very clear for every sentence in the proof what is the role that it plays.
It is also much easier to transform such proofs into machine-checkable format.
The disadvantage is that such proofs can be more tedious to read and write, with less differentiation on the important parts of the arguments versus the more routine ones.

## Notation and conventions { #notationsec }

Most of the notation we discussed above is standard and is used in most mathematical texts. The main points where we diverge are:

* We index the natural numbers $\N$ starting with $0$ (though many other texts, especially in computer science, do the same).

* We also index the set $[n]$ starting with $0$, and hence define it as $\{0,\ldots,n-1\}$. In most texts it is defined as $\{1,\ldots, n \}$. Similarly, we index coordinates of our strings starting with $0$, and hence a string $x\in \{0,1\}^n$ is written as $x_0x_1\cdots x_{n-1}$.

* If $n$ is a natural number then $1^n$ refers not to the number $1$ but rather to the length $n$ string $11\cdots 1$ (that is a string of $n$ ones). Similarly, $0^n$ refers to the length $n$ string $00 \cdots 0$.

* _Partial_ functions  are functions that are not necessarily  defined on all inputs. When we write $f:A \rightarrow B$ this means that $f$ is  a _total_ function unless we say otherwise. When we want to emphasize that $f$ can be  a partial function, we will sometimes write $f: A \rightarrow_p B$.

* As we will see later on in the course, we will mostly describe our computational problems in the terms of computing a _Boolean function_ $f: \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1\}$. In contrast, many other  textbooks refer to the same task as  _deciding a language_ $L \subseteq \{0,1\}^*$. These two viewpoints are equivalent, since for every set $L\subseteq \{0,1\}^*$ there is a corresponding  function $f = 1_L$ such that $f(x)=1$ if and only if $x\in L$. Computing _partial functions_ corresponds to the task known in the literature as a solving a _promise problem_.^[Because the language notation is so prevalent in other textbooks, we will occasionally remind the reader of this correspondence.]

* We use $\ceil{x}$ and $\floor{x}$ for the "ceiling" and "floor" operators that correspond to "rounding up" or "rounding down" a number to the nearest integer. We use $(x \mod y)$ to denote the "remainder" of $x$ when divided by $y$. That is, $(x \mod y) = x - y\floor{x/y}$. In context when an integer is expected we'll typically "silently round" the quantities to an integer. For example, if we say that $x$ is a string of length $\sqrt{n}$ then we'll typically mean that $x$ is  of length $\lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$. (In most such cases, it will not make a difference  whether we round up or down.)


* Like most Computer Science texts, we default to the logarithm in base two. Thus, $\log n$ is the same as $\log_2 n$.

* We will also use the notation $f(n)=poly(n)$ as a short hand for $f(n)=n^{O(1)}$ (i.e., as shorthand for saying that there are some constants $a,b$ such that $f(n) \leq a\cdot n^b$ for every sufficiently large $n$). Similarly, we will use $f(n)=polylog(n)$ as shorthand for $f(n)=poly(\log n)$ (i.e., as shorthand for saying that there are some constants $a,b$ such that $f(n) \leq a\cdot (\log n)^b$ for every sufficiently large $n$).

* As in often the case in mathematical literature, we use the apostrophe character to enrich our set of identifier. Typically if $x$ denotes some object, then $x'$, $x''$, etc. will denote other objects of the same type.

### Conventions

Mathematics (as is coding)  is full of variables. Whenever you see a variable, it is always important to keep track of what is its _type_: is it a number, a function, a string, a graph, a program? To make this easier, we try to stick to certain conventions by which we use certain identifiers for variables of the same type.
Some of these conventions are listed in the following table.
Note that these are conventions and not immutable laws. Sometimes we might deviate from them.
Also, such conventions do not replace the need to explicitly declare for each new variable the type of object that it denotes.



| *Identifier*      | *Is often used to denote an object of the type*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| $x,y,z,w$         | Strings in $\{0,1\}^*$, though sometimes we will use these identifiers numbers or other objects. We will often identify an object with its representation as a string.                                                                                                                  |
| $G$               | A _graph_. The set of vertices of $G$ is often denoted by $V$, and often it is simply the set $[n]=\{0,\ldots, n\}$. The set of edges of $G$ is often denoted by $E$.                                                                                                                   |

| $f,g,h$           | Functions. We will often (thogh not always) use lowercase identifiers for _finite functions_, which map  $\{0,1\}^n$ to $\{0,1\}^m$ (often $m=1$).                                                                                                                                      |
| $F,G,H$           | Infinite (unbounded input) functions mapping $\{0,1\}^*$ to $\{0,1\}^*$ or $\{0,1\}^*$ to $\{0,1\}^m$ for some $m$. Note that the identifiers $G,H$ are sometimes used to denote a function and sometimes a graph. It will always be clear from the context which of these is the case. |

| $c$               | A positive number (often an unspecified constant: for example if $T(n)=O(n)$ then there is some number $c$ such that $T(n) \leq c \cdot n$ every $n>0$). We sometimes use $a,b$ in a similar way.                                                                                       |

* The basic "mathematical data structures" we'll need are _numbers_, _sets_, _tuples_, _strings_, _graphs_ and _functions_.
* We can use basic objects to define more complex notions. For example, _graphs_ can be defined as a list of _pairs_.
* Given precise _definitions_ of objects, we can state unambiguous and precise _statements_. We can then use mathematical _proofs_ to determine whether these statements are true or false.
* A mathematical proof is not a formal ritual but rather a clear, precise and "bulletproof" argument certifying the truth of a certain statement.
* Big-$O$ notation is an extremely useful formalism to suppress less significant details and allow us to focus on the high level behavior of quantities of interest.
* The only way to get comfortable with mathematical notions is to apply them in the contexts of solving problems. You should expect to need to go back time and again to the definitions and notation in this lecture as you work through problems in this course.

## Bibliographical notes { #notesmathchap }

The section heading "A Mathematician's Apology", refers of course to Hardy's classic book [@Hardy41].
Even when Hardy is wrong, he is very much worth reading.

There are many online sources for the mathematical background needed for this book. In particular, the lecture notes for MIT 6.042 "Mathematics for Computer Science" [@LehmanLeightonMeyer] are extremely comprehensive, and videos and assignments for this course are available online.
Similarly, [Berkeley CS 70: "Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theoru"](http://www.eecs70.org/) has extensive lecture notes online.
The book of Rosen [@Rosen19discrete] also covers much of this  material.
See also Jim Aspens' online book [@AspensDiscreteMath].

The book by Lewis and Zax [@LewisZax19], as well as the online book of Fleck [@Fleck], give a more gentle overview of the much of the same material. Solow's book [@Solow14] is a good gentle introduction to proof reading and writing. Kun's book [@Kun18] gives an introduction to mathematics aimed at readers with programming background.
Stanford's [CS 103 course](https://cs103.stanford.edu)  has a wonderful collections of handouts on mathematical proof techniques and discrete mathematics.
